# easy-carousel
This project is built in HTML,CSS/SCSS,javascript, to set up this, just download all files and open index via any browser. images are copied from internet and it doesn't need anything to do. It is carousel and You can switch pictures, it doesn't support touch events, only keyboard events and there are two buttons called Prev and Next, you can use them to switch between pictures too. it is not responsive, but a little bit yes, I haven't worked for that, but it doesn't look bad in mobile phones.
