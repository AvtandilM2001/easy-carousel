# easy-carousel
This project is built in HTML,CSS/SCSS,javascript, to set up this, just download all files and open index via any browser. images are copied from internet and it doesn't need anything to do. It is carousel and You can swich pictures, it doesn't support touch events, only keyboard events and there are two buttons called Prev and Next, you can use them to swich pictures too. it is little bit responsive, I haven't worked for that, but it doesn't look bad in mobile phones.
